# Collage
The Collage python program enables one to convert a base image such as this one of my dog Muggs as George Washington:

And convert into a collage of provided source images, such as all Pokemon:

Caching with a json file is used to decrease processing time after first source image editing process.

Future improvements: 
  Make it easier to scale image to desired size.
  Decrease time required to generate image for larger images.
